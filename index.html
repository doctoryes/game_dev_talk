# Differences

The Big Difference
==================
--

- Binary Files
---
# Binary Files

Types:

-   Animation (motion captured / hand-crafted)

--

-   3D models - Mesh, Textures, Bones

--

-   Graphics - Shaders

--

-   Audio - Sound effects, multitrack audio

--

-   Video - Attract video, cutscenes (if not in-engine)

--

-   Executables!

---
# Binary Files

- No git!

--

    - Perforce - and other solutions.

    - Centralized source control.

    - File locks.

--

__<center>Branching is a *big deal*.</center>__
---
# Engine

- Somewhat akin to a web framework...

--

- Game objects interacting.

--

- Editing environment to create/edit game objects.

--

- Cross-platform concerns.

--

- Input-handling

    - Gamepads

--
    - But also skeletons. And voice!

---
# Performance!

--

- *Must* be (*at least*) 30 FPS. *Always*.

--

- Fast math and optimization.

--

- Many cores - but bottlenecks.

--

- Dev / Release / Ship builds

--

- Editing environment separate from run-time environment.

--
    - All sorts of optimizations and packing in final format.

--
    - Down to the layout of assets on-disk corresponding to in-game loading.
---
# Network

- Game play? No TCP!

    - UDP with customizations

    - Guaranteed transfer or not (re-transmits)

--

- TCP/HTTP ok in menus.

    - Submitting/receiving score data.

    - In-game store.
---
# Scripting

--

- If all game logic is written in code, then only coders can make the game.

--

- Nearly all game engines offer a high-level scripting language.

    - Designers/artists/animators/audio folks use the scripting language.
---
# Business

- Black Friday!

    - *Must* be on the shelves.

--

- Or whatever other synchronous event.

    - Marketing campaign

    - Concert tour

    - Industry show

--

- BOOM! Or bust...

    - Project to project.

---
# Similarities

- Playtesting vs. UX research

--

- Rapid Prototyping!

    - "Find the fun."
