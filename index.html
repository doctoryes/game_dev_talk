# Game Development vs. Web Development
# The Differences

---

# Agenda

1. Introduction

2. Differences (lightning-fast!)

---

# Introduction

Hi! I'm Julia Eskew - Game/Web Developer.
.center[![me](./julia_bitmoji.png)]

I've attended a few Game Developers Conferences - and XFests (Microsoft-run XBox confs).
---

# Titles I've Helped Ship

- EA Sports Supercross 2000 (Playstation One/Nintendo 64)
--

- Backends of lots of ActiveX-based, browser-based, skill-based games, such as:

    - Solitaire Rush, Scrabble Cubes, Wheel of Fortune, Minesweeper, Trivia, etc.
--

- Pirates of the Caribbean Mobile

- EA Sports NASCAR 2007 Mobile (Brew/J2ME)
--

- Rock Band
--

- Rock Band 2
- The Beatles: Rock Band
- Green Day: Rock Band
- Rock Band Network
- Rock Band 3
- Rock Band Blitz
- Dance Central 1/2/3/Spotlight

# Apples vs. Oranges?

# Apples vs. Oranges

(Console) Game Development:

--

- __Fat client__ developed in lower-level language running directly on OS.

--

- Network service is typically secondary (though not always.)

--

Web Development:

--

- Browser-based client using Web "standards" (HTML/CSS/JS)
    - Sometimes using browser plugins.

--

- Most development is performed on the __network service__.

# The Big Difference
--

## Binary Files
.center[![BinaryTunnel](./BinaryTunnel.jpg)]
---
# Binary Files

Types:

-   3D models - Mesh, Textures, Bones

--

-   Animation (motion captured / hand-crafted)

--

-   Graphics - Shaders

--

-   Audio - Sound effects, multitrack audio

--

-   Video - Attract video, cutscenes (if not in-engine)

--

-   World geometry (levels, tile-based, etc.)

--

-   Executables!

---
# Binary Files

- No git!

--

    - Perforce - and other solutions.

    - Centralized source control.

    - File locks.

--

__<center>Branching is a *BIG DEAL*.</center>__
---
# Engine

- Somewhat akin to a web framework...

--

- Game objects interacting.

--

- Editing environment to create/edit game objects.

--

- Cross-platform concerns.

--

- Input-handling

    - Gamepads

--
    - But also skeletons. And voice!

---
# Math!

--

- You __do__ need to know that a plane is defined by a normal vector!

--

- Also lots more:

--

    - Which way is Z facing?
--
    - Right-hand rule
--
    - How to do math fast - fixed point vs. floating point
--
    - Quaternions
--
    - Velocity/acceleration (derivates/integrals - Calculus!)
--
    - Transformation between coordinate systems

---
# Performance!

--

- *Must* be (*at least*) (consistently) 30 FPS. *Always*.

--

- Fast math and optimization.

--

- Many cores - but bottlenecks.

--

- Dev / Release / Ship builds

--

- Editing environment separate from run-time environment.

--
    - All sorts of optimizations and packing in final format.

--
    - Down to the layout of assets on-disk corresponding to in-game loading.
---
# Network

- Web-based? HTTP/S...

    - TCP

    - Maybe Websockets as well.

--

- Game play? No TCP!

    - UDP with customizations

    - Guaranteed transfer or not (re-transmits)

--

- TCP/HTTP ok in menus.

    - Submitting/receiving score data.

    - In-game store.
---
# Scripting

--

- If all game logic is written in code, then only coders can make the game.

--

- Nearly all game engines offer a high-level scripting language.

    - Designers/artists/animators/audio folks use the scripting language.

--

- (BTW: You work with artists/animators/audio folks.)

---
# Business
--

- Black Friday!

    - *Must* be on the shelves.

--

- Or whatever other synchronous event.

    - Marketing campaign

    - Concert tour

    - Industry show

--

- BOOM! Or bust...

    - Project to project.

---
# Many Hats

--

You get to work on __lots__ of neat things.

--

Things I've worked on in games:
--

- Stitching together audio files buffered from CD to say: "Jeff Emig... finishes strong at... second place!"
--

- Crossfading audio files of different-sized motorcycles running at different RPMs to create bike sounds.
--

- Posing a motorcycle rider's legs/arms on a bike based on bike position and rider position using inverse kinematics.
--

- Movement control system for flying villians using a PID controller
--

- Wrote a program to rate the difficulty of card shuffles when using/solving them in a game of Solitaire.
--

- Kinect-based hand cursor used to highlight and select waypoints in a 3D environment.


---
# Similarities

- Playtesting is akin to UX research

--
    - Rapid Prototyping!

--
    - "Find the fun."

--

- Software development

--

    - Same as it ever was....

--
    - Gnarly debugging.

--
    - Estimation and schedules.

--
    - Following best practices.

--
    - Learning the tools and using them effectively.
